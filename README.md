# OSM-sac_scale-map-creating-with-tilemaker

The idea is to create a map which shows the difficulties of hiking pathes and tracks for the Open Street Map source. The attribute "sac_scale" can be used in OSM to declare the difficulty of hiking pathes, https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Key:sac_scale. At the moment the usage of this attribute is far a way to be compete but in higher alpine regions there many pathes available with it. 

https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker has created an excelent tool to creat vector tiles.
